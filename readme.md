## Course Description

In this course, What’s New in React 18, you’ll learn what the new features are in the released version of React 18. You’ll also learn how they will help you update old and create new apps in React that both give the browser user a better experience, as well as use less resources on the user’s computer.
 
First, you’ll explore the new features in the React 18 release.  Next, you’ll discover how straight forward it is to update your existing apps as well as create new ones that take advantage of the new React 18 features.  Those features include the all new Suspense running in Concurrent React as well as the React hooks that leverage concurrent rendering. Finally, you’ll learn how to combine multiple components together using the new Concurrent React features to make your apps better in every way. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of the new features in React 18 so you can take advantage of these in all your existing and new React apps.

## Getting Started
1. **Install [Node 16 (latest-verson) with NPM 17](https://nodejs.org)**.
2. **Clone this repository.** - `https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-whats-new-in-react18` or [download the zip](https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-whats-new-in-react18/archive/master.zip)
3. **Set your default directory to which module you want (example: `cd m3-hands-on-moving-to-concurrent-rendering` - `cd m4-hands-on-with-the-new-react-hooks`
4. **Install Node Packages with Dependencies.** - `npm install`



## Directory Structure Here

Each of the folders here represent one module of the course.  In each folder, there are subfolders that represent the completed code at the end of each clip. Where this is no clip reference, either there is no code in that clip or nothing changed from the previous clip.

Once in a clip directory, the easiest way to test the app is to first install the packages by typing at the root of that directory (in a terminal window or DOS prompt)

`npm install`

Then, do run the app you just need type

`npm run dev`

That will launch the web server on port 3000 where you can browser to it at the url: `http://localhost:3000`


## Background

This course uses the Next.js framework as a demonstraton vehicle for React Hooks. If you want to know more about Next.js you should watch my other course on Pluralsight titled "Building Server-side Rendered React Apps for Beginners". You can find it [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/whats-new-in-react18).
